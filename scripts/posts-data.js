  <p>Breaking into product design isn’t about waiting for someone to hand you a diploma and a job title — it’s about showing that you can solve real problems. Daniel, founder of Techpioneers, didn’t follow a “traditional” path. They started freelancing, learning on the fly, and shipping projects that eventually got them noticed by fast-growing startups.</p>

  
  <h3>1. Build a portfolio that tells a story</h3>
  <p>Daniel swears by curating 3–5 strong case studies instead of dumping every design you’ve ever touched. Employers want to see how you think — not just the pretty screens. Break down the problem, the context, your approach, the messy parts, and finally the outcome. A well-written case study can be more impressive than a flashy visual.</p>

  <p>Pro tip: even side projects count. Redesign an app you love but think could be better. Volunteer for a local nonprofit. Document the process in detail. The story behind the work is what sets you apart.</p>

  <h3>2. Learn the language of product</h3>
  <p>You’re not just designing for pixels, you’re designing for outcomes. Learn the basics of product metrics like <strong>DAU (Daily Active Users)</strong>, retention, and conversion. Practice interviewing users and distilling insights. And don’t overcomplicate it — being able to explain a tradeoff in plain language is often more valuable than throwing around jargon.</p>

  <p>When Frankie first joined a startup team, they weren’t the strongest visual designer in the room, but they stood out because they could connect design choices to business impact. That’s the difference between being “the person who makes things look nice” and being “the designer who shapes product direction.”</p>

  <h3>3. Ship things — even tiny ones</h3>
  <p>Shipping is a muscle. The more you do it, the stronger you get. Frankie recalls that their first shipped product was a rough, buggy Chrome extension — but it landed them an interview. Why? Because it showed initiative, grit, and the ability to take something from idea to launch.</p>

  <p>It doesn’t matter if it’s a portfolio site, a small mobile app, or a Notion template. Put something out there, gather feedback, iterate, and keep moving. A shipped project — no matter how small — always beats a polished mockup sitting in your drafts.</p>

  <h3>4. Find your community</h3>
  <p>Design can feel isolating if you’re learning alone. Frankie suggests joining design Slack groups, Discords, or local meetups. Sharing your work, giving feedback, and connecting with peers will accelerate your growth way faster than grinding in a vacuum.</p>

  <p>Don’t just lurk — participate. Offer feedback, ask questions, and make friends. The design world is smaller than it looks, and relationships often lead to opportunities.</p>

  <h3>5. Stay curious and avoid gatekeepers</h3>
  <p>The design world loves to gatekeep: “You need a design degree.” “You must master Figma before you can start.” Ignore all that. Every great designer started somewhere, usually clumsily. What matters most is staying curious, practicing consistently, and putting your work into the world.</p>

  <p>Daniel puts it simply: <em>“Be curious, be kind, and keep building.”</em></p>

    <h1>Migrating to Linear 101</h1>
    <p>If you’ve been managing projects with tools like Jira, Trello, Asana, or ClickUp, you’ve probably heard about <strong>Linear</strong>. It’s fast, minimal, and built for modern teams who want productivity without the clutter. But making the switch from your current project management tool to Linear might feel daunting at first. This guide will walk you through the essentials of <strong>migrating to Linear</strong>—so you can hit the ground running.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>Why Teams Are Switching to Linear</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed &amp; Simplicity</strong>: Linear is lightning-fast and prioritizes clean workflows.</li>
          <li><strong>Opinionated Design</strong>: Instead of endless customization, Linear offers structured workflows that reduce decision fatigue.</li>
          <li><strong>Keyboard-First Experience</strong>: Power users love Linear’s command palette and shortcuts.</li>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 1: Preparing for Migration</h2>
        <p>Before moving your tasks into Linear, you’ll want to audit your existing system.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identify what matters</strong>: Not every task or backlog item is worth migrating. Archive old issues and bring over only active or high-priority items.</li>
          <li><strong>Map your workflow</strong>: Understand how your current tool’s boards, sprints, or lists translate into Linear’s <em>teams, projects, and cycles</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Set migration goals</strong>: Do you want a clean fresh start or a full import?</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 2: Importing Data into Linear</h2>
        <p>Linear supports direct imports from some popular tools.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jira Importer</strong>: Pulls over issues, projects, and metadata.</li>
          <li><strong>CSV Import</strong>: Useful if your current tool isn’t supported directly.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Tools</strong>: Services like <em>Migrato</em> or <em>Zapsync</em> can help bridge gaps between platforms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Migrate incrementally. Start with one project/team to validate the setup before moving everything.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 3: Setting Up Your Workflow in Linear</h2>
        <p>Once your issues are in Linear, customize the essentials:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Teams</strong> → represent departments (Engineering, Design, Marketing).</li>
          <li><strong>Projects</strong> → major initiatives or product features.</li>
          <li><strong>Cycles</strong> → Linear’s version of sprints; short iterations (1–4 weeks) to maintain focus.</li>
          <li><strong>Labels</strong> → lightweight categorization (bug, feature, urgent).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep it simple at first—avoid over-engineering labels and workflows.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 4: Integrations That Supercharge Linear</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GitHub/GitLab</strong>: Auto-close issues from PRs.</li>
          <li><strong>Slack</strong>: Get updates and create issues directly from chat.</li>
          <li><strong>Figma</strong>: Link designs to issues for context.</li>
          <li><strong>Zapier/Make</strong>: Automate repetitive tasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 5: Onboarding Your Team</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Run a kickoff session</strong> to show the basics of Linear’s UI and shortcuts.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourage cycles</strong> so the team experiences the benefits of shorter, focused iterations.</li>
          <li><strong>Define rituals</strong> (standups, planning, retros) around Linear to build habits.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Migrating everything</strong>: Don’t bring over years of clutter.</li>
          <li><strong>Over-customizing</strong>: Linear works best when kept lean.</li>
          <li><strong>Skipping team training</strong>: If your team doesn’t adopt it, migration fails.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Migrating to Linear isn’t just a tool switch—it’s a mindset shift. By streamlining workflows, focusing on cycles, and integrating with your dev and design stack, Linear helps teams spend less time managing tasks and more time shipping work.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re ready to simplify project management, start small, stay lean, and let Linear’s opinionated approach guide your team toward clarity and speed.

      <h1>Building your API stack</h1>
      <p>
        Building a reliable API stack lets your product expose data and functionality safely, consistently, and at scale.
        This guide covers core decisions and practical steps to design, implement, secure, and operate an API stack fit for production.
      </p>
    </header>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Why a thoughtful API stack matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Decoupling</strong>: Clean interfaces let frontend, mobile, and third-party consumers evolve independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Well-designed APIs power multiple clients and internal services.</li>
        <li><strong>Security &amp; Governance</strong>: Centralized auth, rate limiting, and monitoring protect your data and SLA.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: A resilient stack scales predictably as traffic grows.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 1 — Choose an API style</h2>
      <p>Pick the protocol and shape that best fits your product and team.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>REST</strong>: Simple, cache-friendly, and ubiquitous — great for CRUD-focused APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>GraphQL</strong>: Flexible queries from clients, reduces over/under-fetching — ideal for complex frontends.</li>
        <li><strong>gRPC / Protocol Buffers</strong>: High performance, strong typing, and streaming — excellent for internal microservices.</li>
        <li><strong>WebSockets / SSE</strong>: Real-time updates and event streams when push is required.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2 — Pick the runtime &amp; framework</h2>
      <p>Choose a language and framework that balance developer productivity with operational needs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Node.js (Express, Fastify)</strong>: Rapid development, huge ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>Python (FastAPI, Django REST)</strong>: Great for data-heavy teams and simple async support.</li>
        <li><strong>Go (net/http, Echo)</strong>: Compiled performance, small binaries, predictable concurrency.</li>
        <li><strong>Java/Kotlin (Spring Boot)</strong>: Enterprise features, strong typing, mature ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Prefer frameworks with built-in validation, OpenAPI/Swagger support, and good async handling.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3 — Design the data &amp; persistence layer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Datastore choices</strong>: Relational (Postgres) for transactions and complex queries; document stores (MongoDB) for flexible schemas; specialized stores (Redis, Cassandra) for caching and high-throughput needs.</li>
        <li><strong>ORM vs Query Builders</strong>: Use ORMs for productivity; choose query builders/raw SQL for complex performance-sensitive queries.</li>
        <li><strong>Schema design</strong>: Model endpoints around capabilities, not just DB tables. Consider denormalization for read-heavy APIs.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 4 — Authentication, Authorization &amp; Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auth patterns</strong>: OAuth2 / OpenID Connect for third-party access; JWTs for stateless sessions; API keys for machine-to-machine.</li>
        <li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based (ABAC) as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardening</strong>: Validate and sanitize inputs, use HTTPS everywhere, enforce rate limits and quotas, and apply CORS correctly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 5 — Observability, testing &amp; quality</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Logging</strong>: Structured logs (JSON) with request IDs for traceability.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracing &amp; Metrics</strong>: Use OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and tracing (Jaeger) to understand latency and flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing</strong>: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for the API surface, contract tests for clients, and load tests for performance.</li>
        <li><strong>API docs</strong>: Auto-generate OpenAPI/GraphQL schema docs and publish them for consumers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 6 — CI/CD, deployment &amp; scaling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CI/CD</strong>: Automate linting, tests, schema validation, and build artifacts before deploys.</li>
        <li><strong>Containers &amp; orchestration</strong>: Use Docker and Kubernetes for consistent environments and autoscaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Serverless options</strong>: Consider FaaS (AWS Lambda, Cloud Run) for infrequent workloads or simplified ops.</li>
        <li><strong>Scaling strategies</strong>: Horizontal scaling, database read replicas, caching layers, and asynchronous background workers for heavy jobs.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 7 — Versioning &amp; backwards compatibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Versioning strategy</strong>: Use URL versioning (/v1/...), header-based, or semantic evolution depending on client needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Backward compatibility</strong>: Additive changes only where possible; deprecate with clear timelines and warnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Client contracts</strong>: Maintain client SDKs or generated clients to reduce integration friction.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No schema governance</strong>: Uncontrolled changes break clients—use schema reviews and CI checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring observability</strong>: Production issues are costly without metrics and traces in place.</li>
        <li><strong>Overloading the API</strong>: Trying to solve every use case in one endpoint creates brittle surfaces—favor small, composable endpoints or GraphQL when appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping security reviews</strong>: Auth flaws and injection bugs are common vectors—prioritize threat modeling and audits.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        A great API stack balances developer ergonomics, operational reliability, and client needs. Start with clear design principles, instrument early, automate quality checks, and iterate based on real usage. With those foundations, your API becomes a durable product that scales with your team and customers.

      <h1>Bill Walsh: Leadership Lessons</h1>
      <p>
        Bill Walsh, the legendary San Francisco 49ers head coach, transformed a struggling franchise into a dynasty.
        His leadership philosophy, known as “The Standard of Performance,” went beyond football—offering timeless lessons
        for anyone leading teams, organizations, or personal projects.
      </p>
    </header>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Lesson 1 — Establish a Standard of Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Walsh believed success wasn’t achieved by focusing on the scoreboard. Instead, he instilled precise standards
        for how players, coaches, and staff conducted themselves—on and off the field.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear expectations for preparation, communication, and execution.</li>
        <li>Professionalism in dress, punctuality, and interactions.</li>
        <li>Emphasis on doing the small things right, every time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Define and uphold non-negotiable standards. Excellence in process leads to excellence in outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Lesson 2 — Build a Culture Before Chasing Wins</h2>
      <p>
        When Walsh joined the 49ers in 1979, the team had a losing record. He didn’t talk about championships—he focused on building
        a culture of discipline, accountability, and pride. The wins followed naturally.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Prioritize culture over short-term results. A healthy system will generate long-term success.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Lesson 3 — Innovate Relentlessly</h2>
      <p>
        Walsh introduced the West Coast Offense, a revolutionary passing strategy that changed the NFL. His willingness to challenge
        conventions gave his team a competitive edge.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Don’t be afraid to question traditional playbooks in your field. Innovation can set you apart.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Lesson 4 — Develop Leaders at Every Level</h2>
      <p>
        Many of Walsh’s assistants went on to become successful head coaches, spreading his influence across the league.
        He invested in people, not just plays.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Multiply leadership by mentoring and empowering others. A strong organization creates leaders, not followers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Lesson 5 — Stay Calm Under Pressure</h2>
      <p>
        Walsh was known for his composed sideline demeanor. He believed panic was contagious, and that leaders must model
        poise in high-stakes moments.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Composure and confidence inspire trust. In crises, your reaction sets the tone for the entire team.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Bill Walsh’s leadership extended far beyond football. By focusing on standards, culture, innovation, mentorship, and composure,
        he built a dynasty that endures as a model of excellence. His lessons remind us that true leadership is less about
        chasing results and more about building the foundation that makes results inevitable.

      <h1>PM Mental Models</h1>
      <p>
        Great product managers rely on more than tools and frameworks—they lean on mental models to make
        better decisions, balance trade-offs, and guide their teams. These models provide clarity in complexity
        and help PMs stay grounded when navigating uncertainty.
      </p>
    </header>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>1 — The Build–Measure–Learn Loop</h2>
      <p>
        Popularized by Lean Startup, this model emphasizes short iterations: build something small,
        measure its impact, and learn quickly. It ensures teams don’t over-invest in unproven ideas.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Application:</strong> Release MVPs, validate assumptions, and avoid building features no one needs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2 — The Kano Model</h2>
      <p>
        The Kano framework helps prioritize features by categorizing them as basic expectations,
        performance drivers, or delightful surprises.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Application:</strong> Balance must-have functionality with features that create emotional impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3 — Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)</h2>
      <p>
        Customers “hire” products to do a job for them. Focusing on the job clarifies why people choose
        one solution over another.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Application:</strong> Frame features around solving core problems, not just adding functionality.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4 — Opportunity Cost</h2>
      <p>
        Every “yes” is also a “no” to something else. Recognizing trade-offs keeps roadmaps realistic
        and aligned with priorities.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Application:</strong> Use this lens in backlog grooming and when stakeholders push for more scope.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5 — The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)</h2>
      <p>
        Often, 80% of the value comes from 20% of the work. Identifying that critical subset helps teams
        focus effort where it matters most.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Application:</strong> Prioritize high-leverage initiatives instead of spreading resources thin.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6 — First Principles Thinking</h2>
      <p>
        Break problems down into their fundamental truths instead of relying on assumptions or industry
        conventions. From there, build solutions from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Application:</strong> Challenge legacy processes or “that’s how it’s always been done” mindsets.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7 — The Inversion Principle</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of asking “How do we succeed?”, ask “What would cause us to fail?” and design against
        those risks. It’s a powerful way to identify blind spots.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Application:</strong> Use in pre-mortems or risk planning sessions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Mental models won’t make decisions for you, but they sharpen your judgment. By practicing models
        like Build–Measure–Learn, JTBD, and Opportunity Cost, PMs can navigate trade-offs with more confidence,
        lead teams with clarity, and ultimately build products that resonate with users.

      <h1>What is Wireframing?</h1>
      <p>
        Wireframing is the process of creating a basic, low-fidelity visual guide that represents the structure,
        layout, and functionality of a digital product such as a website or mobile app. Think of it as the blueprint
        for your design—it shows what goes where before investing time in detailed visuals or code.
      </p>
    </header>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Why Wireframe?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Helps teams align on layout and user flow before design polish begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Quick to create and easy to change when exploring different ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Provides a shared reference point for designers, developers, and stakeholders.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Identifies usability issues early, before expensive development work.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of Wireframes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low-fidelity:</strong> Simple sketches or outlines showing basic page structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-fidelity:</strong> Digital wireframes with clearer layouts, grayscale elements, and labeled sections.</li>
        <li><strong>High-fidelity:</strong> More detailed mockups that begin to resemble the final design but still focus on structure over style.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tools for Wireframing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pen and paper (great for brainstorming).</li>
        <li>Digital tools like Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or Balsamiq.</li>
        <li>Whiteboarding apps like Miro or Whimsical for collaborative sessions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it simple—focus on layout and flow, not colors or branding.</li>
        <li>Label elements clearly so others understand your intent.</li>
        <li>Think about the user journey and ensure navigation is intuitive.</li>
        <li>Iterate quickly and gather feedback before moving to high-fidelity design.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Wireframing bridges the gap between ideas and execution. By sketching out layouts and flows early,
        teams can collaborate effectively, spot problems sooner, and build digital products with a strong
        foundation. In short, wireframes are the blueprint that guide great design.

      <h1>How Collaboration Makes Us Better Designers</h1>
      <p>
        Design is often seen as a solo creative pursuit, but the reality is that the best products come from
        collective effort. Collaboration helps designers expand their perspectives, refine their ideas, and
        ultimately create solutions that serve users more effectively.
      </p>
    </header>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>1 — Broader Perspectives</h2>
      <p>
        Working with others introduces new ways of thinking. Designers gain insights from developers, product
        managers, marketers, and even users. Each perspective highlights different needs and constraints that
        strengthen the final design.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2 — Faster Problem-Solving</h2>
      <p>
        Collaboration reduces blind spots. By brainstorming and reviewing ideas as a group, teams can identify
        weak points early and move toward solutions faster. What might take one person days to figure out can
        often be resolved in a single collaborative session.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3 — Shared Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        When multiple voices contribute, the design feels like a shared achievement. This sense of ownership
        motivates everyone to see the product succeed and ensures smoother handoffs between design,
        development, and delivery.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4 — Continuous Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Collaboration is a learning loop. Designers pick up technical knowledge from engineers, strategic
        thinking from product managers, and storytelling techniques from marketers. Over time, this cross-pollination
        builds stronger, more versatile designers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5 — Better Alignment with Users</h2>
      <p>
        Collaboration often includes user research and feedback sessions. By working closely with users, teams
        ensure designs solve real problems instead of making assumptions. This leads to more meaningful, usable
        products.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Great design doesn’t happen in isolation. Collaboration enriches the process, reduces mistakes, and creates
        solutions that reflect diverse perspectives. By embracing teamwork, designers not only improve their craft
        but also deliver products that resonate more deeply with users.

      <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is a stylesheet language used to control the
        presentation and layout of HTML documents. While HTML structures the content of a web page,
        CSS defines how that content looks—its colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design.
      </p>
    </header>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Why CSS Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Keeps content (HTML) separate from presentation (CSS).</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Allows uniform styling across multiple pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> A single CSS file can control the style of an entire website.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Supports responsive design for different screen sizes and devices.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How CSS Works</h2>
      <p>
        CSS applies styles through <em>rules</em>, each consisting of a selector and a declaration block.
        The selector targets HTML elements, while the declaration block defines how those elements should appear.
      </p>
      <pre>
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        In the example above, all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements are styled with blue text and a 16px font size.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Cascade</h2>
      <p>
        The “cascading” in CSS refers to the way styles are applied when multiple rules conflict.
        CSS follows a priority system:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Browser defaults</li>
        <li>External stylesheets</li>
        <li>Internal styles (inside <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags)</li>
        <li>Inline styles (on the element itself)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Specificity and importance (using <code>!important</code>) further influence which styles take effect.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inline CSS:</strong> Written directly on elements via the <code>style</code> attribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal CSS:</strong> Placed inside <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags in an HTML file.</li>
        <li><strong>External CSS:</strong> Stored in a separate <code>.css</code> file and linked to HTML pages.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Modern CSS Features</h2>
      <p>
        CSS has evolved far beyond basic styling. Today’s CSS supports:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexbox and Grid for advanced layouts</li>
        <li>Custom properties (CSS variables)</li>
        <li>Animations and transitions</li>
        <li>Media queries for responsive design</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        CSS is the foundation of web design. It transforms raw HTML into visually appealing, user-friendly
        experiences. From simple styling to complex responsive layouts, CSS empowers developers to bring
        creative visions to life on the web.
